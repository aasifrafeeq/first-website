		<div id="a"> my life began when i realized the real meaning of life.</div>
		<p>Every thing present in this world is based on us.We are the ones who are responsiblee forr all the events that takeplace in out life. 
		If something has to be done we are the ones to do it</p>
		<p style="size:50;"><b>DON'T STOP WHEN YOU'RE TIRED, STOP WHEN YOU ARE DONE.,</b></p>
		<p>You might be a person who have done many sins yesterday,who may have got in fights for no reason ,ITS DONE and you can't reverse it,If you could have there would have been no meaning for life..
		So what I'm trying to tell you is that try to move on as there is no meaning in worrying about something that had happened along time ago.
